# Python Functions and Loops Revision

#### This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created to revise and practice functions and loops. Each script addresses a specific problem and demonstrates the use of fundamental programming concepts in Python.

## Description of Scripts

> Amicable Numbers (amicable_numbers.py)

This script returns all amicable numbers within a given range. Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number.

> Armstrong Number (armstrong_number.py)

This script checks if a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). An Armstrong number is an n-digit number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of n.

> Multiplication Table (multiplication_table.py)

This script generates and returns the multiplication table for a given number.

> Permutations and Combinations (permutations_combinations.py)

This script calculates and returns the permutations and combinations for given values of p (number of items) and c (items to choose from).

> Prime Factors (prime_factors.py)

This script returns all prime factors of a given number.

> Proper Number (proper_number.py)

This script checks if a given number is a proper number. A proper number (or a perfect number) is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.

> Twin Primes (twin_primes.py)

This script finds and returns all twin prime numbers within a given range. Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that differ by exactly 2.
Decimal to Binary (decimal_to_binary.py)


This script converts a given decimal number to its binary representation.

> Product of Digits (product_of_digits.py)

This script calculates and returns the product of the digits of a given number.
